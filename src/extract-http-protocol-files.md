# Exporting Files Transmitted via HTTP Protocol

This feature allows us to export files transmitted using the HTTP protocol from captured packets, such as images and binary files.

Currently, it cannot identify files transmitted using range requests or gzip compression. However, we will gradually improve this feature in the future as the demand is confirmed.
