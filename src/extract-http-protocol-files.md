# Exporting Files Transmitted via HTTP Protocol

This feature allows us to export files transmitted using the HTTP protocol from captured packets, such as images and binary files.

Currently, we are unable to identify files transmitted using HTTP Range requests or those compressed with gzip. If there is indeed a demand for this functionality in the future, we will gradually improve it.
