# Generate tcpdump command using ChatTCP

If you are using tcpdump for the first time, you may not know how to write the commands.

If you do not use tcpdump frequently, you might forget how to write the commands each time you need to use it.

ChatTCP provides a small tool to help us quickly construct tcpdump commands, so you don't have to search for how to write tcpdump commands every time.
