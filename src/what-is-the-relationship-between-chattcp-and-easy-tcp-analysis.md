# What is the relationship between ChatTCP and Easy TCP Analysis?

ChatTCP is the offline version of Easy TCP Analysis, renamed accordingly.

ChatTCP inherits the core features of Easy TCP Analysis. Additionally, ChatTCP has been optimized for offline environments and includes several new features, such as support for more complex search requirements and application-layer protocol decoding.

ChatTCP is suitable for any scenario, whether it's for learning and mastering the TCP protocol or for troubleshooting issues at work. With the offline version, there are no concerns about data leakage.

On October 30, 2024, Easy TCP Analysis underwent a revision and was merged into ChatTCP, providing ChatTCP with basic online experience functionality. The original domain name is no longer in use.

> The original domain name https://www.easy-tcp-analysis.tools has been replaced with https://online.chattcp.com.
